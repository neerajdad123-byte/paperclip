# Paperclip is the app people use to manage AI agents for work.

Open-source orchestration for teams of AI agents.

**If OpenClaw is an _employee_, Paperclip is the _company_.**

Paperclip is a Node.js server and React UI that orchestrates a team of AI agents to run a business. Bring your own agents, assign goals, and track work and costs from one dashboard.

It looks like a task manager. Under the hood: org charts, budgets, governance, goal alignment, and agent coordination.

**Manage business goals, not pull requests.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the goal | _"Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR."_                    |
| **02** | Hire the team   | CEO, CTO, engineers, designers, marketers — any bot, any provider. |
| **03** | Approve and run | Review strategy. Set budgets. Hit go. Monitor from the dashboard.  |

## Problems Paperclip solves

| Without Paperclip                                                                                                                     | With Paperclip                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You have 20 Claude Code tabs open and can't track which one does what. On reboot you lose everything.                              | ✅ Tasks are ticket-based, conversations are threaded, sessions persist across reboots.                                                |
| ❌ You manually gather context from several places to remind your bot what you're actually doing.                                     | ✅ Context flows from the task up through the project and company goals — your agent always knows what to do and why.                  |
| ❌ Folders of agent configs are disorganized and you're re-inventing task management, communication, and coordination between agents. | ✅ Paperclip gives you org charts, ticketing, delegation, and governance out of the box — so you run a company, not a pile of scripts. |
| ❌ Runaway loops waste hundreds of dollars of tokens and max your quota before you even know what happened.                           | ✅ Cost tracking surfaces token budgets and throttles agents when they're out. Management prioritizes with budgets.                    |
| ❌ You have recurring jobs (customer support, social, reports) and have to remember to manually kick them off.                        | ✅ Heartbeats handle regular work on a schedule. Management supervises.                                                                |
| ❌ You have an idea, you have to find your repo, fire up Claude Code, keep a tab open, and babysit it.                                | ✅ Add a task in Paperclip. Your coding agent works on it until it's done. Management reviews their work.                              |

## Why Paperclip is special

Paperclip handles the hard orchestration details correctly.

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic execution.**             | Task checkout and budget enforcement are atomic, so no double-work and no runaway spend.                      |
| **Persistent agent state.**       | Agents resume the same task context across heartbeats instead of restarting from scratch.                     |
| **Runtime skill injection.**      | Agents can learn Paperclip workflows and project context at runtime, without retraining.                      |
| **Governance with rollback.**     | Approval gates are enforced, config changes are revisioned, and bad changes can be rolled back safely.        |
| **Goal-aware execution.**         | Tasks carry full goal ancestry so agents consistently see the "why," not just a title.                        |
| **Portable company templates.**   | Export/import orgs, agents, and skills with secret scrubbing and collision handling.                          |
| **True multi-company isolation.** | Every entity is company-scoped, so one deployment can run many companies with separate data and audit trails. |

## What's Under the Hood

Paperclip is a full control plane, not a wrapper. Before you build any of this yourself, know that it already exists:

### The Systems

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Identity & Access** — Two deployment modes (trusted local or authenticated), board users, agent API keys, short-lived run JWTs, company memberships, invite flows, and OpenClaw onboarding. Every mutating request is traced to an actor.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Org Chart & Agents** — Agents have roles, titles, reporting lines, permissions, and budgets. Adapter examples match the diagram: Claude Code, Codex, CLI agents such as Cursor/Gemini/bash, HTTP/webhook bots such as OpenClaw, and external adapter plugins. If it can receive a heartbeat, it's hired.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Work & Task System** — Issues carry company/project/goal/parent links, atomic checkout with execution locks, first-class blocker dependencies, comments, documents, attachments, work products, labels, and inbox state. No double-work, no lost context.

</td>
<td>

**Heartbeat Execution** — DB-backed wakeup queue with coalescing, budget checks, workspace resolution, secret injection, skill loading, and adapter invocation. Runs produce structured logs, cost events, session state, and audit trails. Recovery handles orphaned runs automatically.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Workspaces & Runtime** — Project workspaces, isolated execution workspaces (git worktrees, operator branches), and runtime services (dev servers, preview URLs). Agents work in the right directory with the right context every time.

</td>
<td>

**Governance & Approvals** — Board approval workflows, execution policies with review/approval stages, decision tracking, budget hard-stops, agent pause/resume/terminate, and full audit logging. Nothing ships without your sign-off.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Budget & Cost Control** — Token and cost tracking by company, agent, project, goal, issue, provider, and model. Scoped budget policies with warning thresholds and hard stops. Overspend pauses agents and cancels queued work automatically.

</td>
<td>

**Routines & Schedules** — Recurring tasks with cron, webhook, and API triggers. Concurrency and catch-up policies. Each routine execution creates a tracked issue and wakes the assigned agent — no manual kick-offs needed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Plugins** — Instance-wide plugin system with out-of-process workers, capability-gated host services, job scheduling, tool exposure, and UI contributions. Extend Paperclip without forking it.

</td>
<td>

**Secrets & Storage** — Instance and company secrets, encrypted local storage, provider-backed object storage, attachments, and work products. Sensitive values stay out of prompts unless a scoped run explicitly needs them.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Activity & Events** — Mutating actions, heartbeat state changes, cost events, approvals, comments, and work products are recorded as durable activity so operators can audit what happened and why.

</td>
<td>

**Company Portability** — Export and import entire organizations — agents, skills, projects, routines, and issues — with secret scrubbing and collision handling. One deployment, many companies, complete data isolation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## What Paperclip is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a chatbot.**           | Agents have jobs, not chat windows.                                                                                  |
| **Not an agent framework.**  | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run a company made of them.                                |
| **Not a workflow builder.**  | No drag-and-drop pipelines. Paperclip models companies — with org charts, goals, budgets, and governance.            |
| **Not a prompt manager.**    | Agents bring their own prompts, models, and runtimes. Paperclip manages the organization they work in.               |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, you probably don't need Paperclip. If you have twenty — you definitely do. |
| **Not a code review tool.**  | Paperclip orchestrates work, not pull requests. Bring your own review process.                                       |

<br/>

## Quickstart

### Pre-built .exe (Windows — no build required)

1. Download `Paperclip.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HenkDz/paperclip/releases)
2. Place it inside the repo folder (where `package.json` lives)
3. Run `Paperclip.exe` — that's it

The .exe needs the repo's `node_modules` at runtime. If you cloned the repo:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/HenkDz/paperclip.git
cd paperclip
pnpm install
# Drop Paperclip.exe here and double-click
```

### Build from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/HenkDz/paperclip.git
cd paperclip
pnpm install
pnpm desktop:build      # Build UI + server bundle
# Launch: desktop\dist-electron\win-unpacked\Paperclip.exe
```

> **Requirements:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+

## Fork Changes

### 🖥️ Windows Desktop App (`desktop/`)

Native Electron wrapper — double-click to run. No terminal, no browser tab hunting.

- **In-process server** — Paperclip server runs inside Electron
- **System tray** — minimize to tray, right-click to show/quit
- **Single instance lock** — second launch focuses existing window
- **Data** stored in `%APPDATA%/paperclip-desktop/`
- All features identical to the web version — same server, same UI

```powershell
pnpm desktop:dev        # Build + launch Electron (dev mode)
pnpm desktop:build      # Build UI + server bundle
pnpm desktop:dist       # Full .exe (NSIS installer)
```

### 🛠️ NTFS QoL Patches

- `stderr_group` — amber accordion for MCP init noise in run transcripts
- `tool_group` — collapsible accordion for consecutive non-terminal tools
- `Dashboard excerpt` — strips markdown, shows first 3 lines/280 chars
- `vite build` — use `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` (NTFS workaround)

### 🔌 Externalized Adapters

- Hermes adapter removed from core — install via Board → Adapter Manager
- Plugin system supports external adapter loading
- Branch: `feat/externalize-hermes-adapter`
